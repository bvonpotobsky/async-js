### Welcome to the Async JavaScript repository.

This is a repository of the Async Javascript Series of [Ania Kub√≥w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdvruTuWvW8).

I recommend it for anyone who wants a better understanding of how XMLHttpRequest, callbacks, promises and async/await works.

In the first folder you will find the necessary material to make an XMLHttpRequest. Yep, it is an old method but it is always good to understand what happens behind the scenes for a better control of the new data request methods.
